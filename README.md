# Chapter-2-4-Homework-Notes (Head First Java) | Alexandria Paul

Chapter 2 - introduces the core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. It explains that Java is an object-oriented language, meaning everything in Java revolves around objects and classes. 
- Classes and Objects: A class is like a blueprint, and objects are the instances of these classes.
- Methods and Behaviors: Classes contain methods, which define behaviors.
- Instance Variables and State: Objects hold state through instance variables ( also know as fields). Each object has its own copy of these variables
- Encapsulation: Refers to the methods that operate on the data within one class while keeping them hidden from outside the class.
- Creating Objects: The syntax for creating objects is introduced, using new to instantiate a class.

Chapter 3 - covers different types of variables in Java 
- Primitive Types: Java has built-in primitive types used to store single pieces of information.
- Reference Variables: hold references to objects.
- Arrays: Java arrays are introduced as a way to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. Arrays are zero-indexed and can be of any type, including objects.

Chapter 4 - Focuses on how objects interact with each other and behave during program execution. Objects communicate by calling each other’s methods
- Getters and Setters: Methods that allow access to an object’s variables (getters) and to modify the variables (setters). They provide access to a private object
- Return Types: Methods can return values using return types
- Constructors: Constructors are special methods used to initialize new objects. often set the initial state of the object.
